# Learn Markdown

## Key terms and definitions

| **Term / Concept**   | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| **Markdown**               | The text displayed in the terminal indicating readiness to accept commands.                                                                                                       |
| **Markdown Syntax**        | The set of rules and symbols used to format text in Markdown, such as headers, bold, italics, lists, and links, which are crucial for structuring and styling a document.         |
| **Plain Text**             | Unformatted text, which is the basis for writing in Markdown. It’s the raw text without any additional formatting, which Markdown then converts into styled content.              |
| **Prompt**                 | The text displayed in the terminal indicating where you enter commands, often ending in a dollar sign ($) or greater-than sign (>).                                               |
| **Static Site Generators** | Tools that convert Markdown files into static HTML websites. Understanding these is important as they often form part of the publishing process for Markdown-based documentation. |
| **Version Control**        | Systems that track changes to files over time, such as Git. These are often used in conjunction with Markdown to manage revisions and collaboration on documentation projects.    |

## Using Markdown

1. **Writing in Markdown:** It all begins when you write your document using Markdown syntax in a plain text file, typically saved with an .md or .markdown extension.

2. **Conversion Tools:** To transform this file into HTML or another format, you'll use a Markdown editor or converter. These tools range from simple command-line scripts to more sophisticated desktop applications, akin to Microsoft Word.

3. **Processing the Markdown:** Under the hood of these applications is a Markdown processor or parser that interprets your Markdown syntax and outputs HTML. This conversion allows the styled content to be viewed in web browsers.

4. **Viewing or Printing:** Once converted to HTML, the document is ready to be opened in any web browser. For printing or sharing, you can further convert it to a format like PDF, often using the same Markdown tool.
