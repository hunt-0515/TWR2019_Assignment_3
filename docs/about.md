# What is this site about?

This site was built for the course TWR2019 Developing Technical Communication. It was developed using Docusaurus, and its pages are written in [Markdown](markdown).

The project requirements were to:

- [x] Create a Docusaurus project with Node.js.
- [x] Edit the home, about, and contact pages.
- [x] Customize theme
- [x] Add custom plugins (search feature!)
- [x] Build the site and deploy to GitHub Pages

:::info[**The Goal**]
This site will host my personal quick reference for common Markdown usage and syntax.
